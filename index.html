          <h5>Consumption in thousand gigawatt-hours</h5><br>
          <p>Published by <a href="#" >Statista Research Department</a>, <br>Dec 14, 2023</p> <br>
          <p> <strong>Coal as the leading energy source</strong></p> <br>
          <p>The total electricity consumption in the Philippines amounted to about 112 thousand gigawatt-hours in 2022, indicating an increase from the previous year. The country's electricity consumption gradually increased year-on-year until 2020.</p><br>
          <p>Electricity generation in the Philippines is mainly powered by coal, accounting for about 58 percent of the total <a href="">power generation mix</a>. Driven by its energy composition and price compared to other energy sources, coal has been powering the country for decades. However, due to a much <a href="">lower production output compared to consumption levels</a>, most of the country's <a href="">coal supply is imported</a>, mainly from Indonesia.</p>
          <p> <strong>Is the Philippine energy composition going green? </strong></p> <br>
          <p>The heavy dependence on coal for power generation raised the alarm of environmental activists and various organizations across the Philippines. Burning coal to produce electricity has been significantly polluting the environment, with <a href="">greenhouse gas emissions</a> in 2021 reaching nearly twice as much as recorded at the start of the decade. Calls to utilize cleaner energy sources were amplified, as the country has abundant solar, hydro, and geothermal energy. Yet, despite the passage of the Renewable Energy Act in 2008, renewables only made up less than a quarter of the total energy mix.</p>
